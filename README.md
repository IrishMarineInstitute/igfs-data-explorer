  <p><b>Irish Groundfish Survey (IGFS) Data Explorer</b></p>
  <p>The IGFS is part of an internationally coordinated series of demersal trawl surveys that provides data on fish stocks that are not available from sampling commercial fishing trips.  It provides both environmental and biological data on areas of high and low commercial activity. The IGFS app allows users to explore the results of the survey using a number of tools â€“ people can explore the higher level summary information and delve into species specific data.</p>
  <p>Below are the links to the source code for each of the phase 1 projects.  As well as source code there is links to docker hub images for running each of the applications</p>
  <p>A Docker image can be created from the Dockerfile in the repo.  Alternatively you can run a container from a pre-created image on our Docker Hub repo<a href ="https://cloud.docker.com/u/informaticsmarine/repository/list"> that can be found here</a>  </p>
